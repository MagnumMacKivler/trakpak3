GaugeName = "rsg" #Short abbreviation for the gauge, used for auto-naming.
Scale = 1 #Overall scale factor for brush generation. Model will be scaled back down in the QC. Should be a power of two (1, 2, 4, etc).
# !!! Be careful about using large numbers with large track pieces. An 8192-radius 90 degree curve at 2x scale will go off the hammer grid !!!
RidiculousTies = 3 #Changes how ties and roadbed are handled. Note that switches will use whatever they need to in order to look correct.
#0 - Composite Textures: Uses one texture for the roadbed and ties. Cheapest option but limits the number of skins.
#1 - 2D Ties: Splits the ties and roadbed into two textures, placing the ties a small distance above the other. This greatly increases skin limit but adds a small number of extra polygons.
#2 - 2.5D Ties: Each tie is its own flat rectangle. This eliminates a lot of tiling issues seen with the above two modes, but adds a modest amount to the polygon count.
#3 - 3D Ties: Each tie is a 5-faced box. The most realistic tie option, but adds a lot of extra polygons. The model won't lag, but the compile time will be longer!
